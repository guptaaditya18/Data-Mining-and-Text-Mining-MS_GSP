# Data Mining and Text Mining Project.
This is the implementation of MS-GSP algorithm for Data Mining and text Mining
The model is built for any transactional data.

The algorithim from "Web Data Mining and text Mining" by Bing Liu. (https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642194597)
Algorithm can be found in page 46.

# Code Usage:
Data file: add the data to Sample.txt
MIS values: add MIS valus to mis.txt
Output: File data_output contains the output for the given data.
